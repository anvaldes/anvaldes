# 👋 Hi, I'm Alberto Valdés

I'm a Machine Learning & AI Engineer with over 4 years of experience designing, deploying, and leading end-to-end AI solutions across sectors like consulting, banking, insurance, and investment.

My work focuses on building robust and scalable ML/AI systems using cloud platforms such as **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**, and **Databricks**. I specialize in both **Data Pipelines** and **ML Pipelines**, working with structured and unstructured data (text, images, video, audio) in batch and streaming environments.

Some of the areas I work in include:

- **Machine Learning**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Transformers & LLMs** (Fine-tuning, RAG, LangChain, Hugging Face)
- **Chatbots**
- **OCR**, **NER** 
- **Time Series and Statistical Modeling**

With a strong academic foundation in **Applied Mathematics**, **Optimization**, and **Statistics**, I’m passionate about solving complex problems through AI and delivering real-world impact with clean, well-documented code.
